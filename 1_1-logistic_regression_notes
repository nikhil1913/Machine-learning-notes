LOGESTIC REGRESSION NOTES

Logistic Regression -> it is an algorithm to train our model for binary clasification
"" it is an algo used to predict the binary outcome based on the set of independent variable
   The outcome will be always discrete ""


linear regression                               logistic regression
used to solve regression problems            used to solve classification probelm
response variable are continous              response variable is categorial
estimate Y based on the change on X          calculate the probability of event to take place
graph - straight line                        graph  -  gigmoid curve

** not in its real from but it is also used in image classification as well **
