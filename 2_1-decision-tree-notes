DECISION TREE NOTES :

  Decision tree is a tree shaped diagram used to determine a course of action . each baranch of a tree represents a possible decision , oversome or reation/

It is used in both Regression and Clasification
  Classification = a clasification tree determine a set of logical if-then condition to classify problem
  Regression = a regression tree is used when the target variable is contigous or numerical in nature.
              we fit a regression model to target vairable using eacch independet variable . each split is made based on the sum of squared error


TERMS used in decission tree:
1-> ENTROPY : the measure of randomness or unpredictability
2-> INFORMATION GAIN : measure of decrease in entropy after data is getting splitted
3-> LEAF NODE : leaf node carries a classification or decission

RULES OF SPLITING :
  while spliting we have to frame condition in such a way that after splitting the INFORMATION GAIN should be maximum.

  formaulae behing it is ** summasion(i=0 to n)P(value)*log2(value) **

for more knowledge and practical gain we are praticing it on loan repayment prediction model
